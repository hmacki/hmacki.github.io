        <h2> A little about me...</h2>
        <p> I'm a 20 year old junior at the University of Miami. I'm majoring in broadcast journalism and sport administration.
            One day I hope to work in the sport communication world. I'm currently leaning more toward a job behind the scenes.
            I like the idea of working in the production studio of a sports show or in a public relations role for a team. My favorite sport to enjoy is football, but I think if I worked for a team, I'd want to work in a different sport.
        </p>
        <p>I grew up in Westminster, MD with my Mom, Dad, and younger sister Savanna. When I turned 10, we moved to a very small town in Wyoming. We only lived
        out there for 2 years before moving back home. We moved to Hanover, PA. This is where my family currently lives only 25 minutes away from where I grew up.
        My sister just turned 18 and started her first year of college, so my parents are empty nesters at home. They don't mind because we have three dogs to keep them company.
        </p>
