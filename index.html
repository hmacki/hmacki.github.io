                <h2>Introduction</h2>

                <p>In 1861, Italy became a nation-state under King Victor Emmanuel II.</p>
                <p>A dictatorship took over the parlimentary government in the early 1920s under Benito Mussolini. This shift led to an alliance with Nazi Germany, and ultimately, a loss in World War II.</p>
                <p>Economic prosperity followed Italy's switch to a democratic republic in 1946. Now, Italy is a charter member of NATO and the European Economic Community.</p>
                <p>However, Italy faces problems as does the rest of the world. Some current issues include: slow economic growth, youth and female unemployment rates, organized crime, and economic disparities between southern and northern Italy.</p>
